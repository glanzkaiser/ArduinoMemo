# ArduinoMemo
Arduino Uno ino files and Fritzing for circuit schematic

Made by Glanz and Freya from Valhalla with Love
this project is started in November 2021 and postponed recently since March 2022 we are not playing with Arduino Uno 
because we are focusing on writing science books and polishing GFreya OS with STEM software (VTK, Bullet, Paraview, OpenFOAM, BLAS-LAPACK-ARPACK, Eigen, ODE, Julia, etc).

# Last Arduino Project
MAX4466

# To-Do Lists
1. Focus finish MAX4466 with FFT example and Notes and Chord detector for violin or human voice
2. Solve the problem of Multiplexer Address that can't be found 
3. Add IC from Sparkfun
4. Learn about PROGMEM, and its example
5. Funduino Joystick + Servo
6. Race Car F18G with NRF24L01
7. Try Tetris -> Done (want to enlarge the display and better rotary control)
8. Try Formula F18G -> Done, need to control with A3 analog input joystick (what can replace analog steering wheel?)
9. Try Snake game on LCD I2C 20x4 with Rotary Encoder
10. Stepper Motor need power supply adapter 5V
11. Lithium Battery is out of power can't bring Arduino outside, needs to learn to charge it with solar energy

# Some useful information
BMP280 address 0x77
SSD1306 Address 0x3C
